## Column Pinning Guide

TanStack Table offers state and APIs helpful for implementing column pinning features in your table UI. You can implement column pinning in multiple ways. You can either split pinned columns into their own separate tables, or you can keep all columns in the same table, but use the pinning state to order the columns correctly and use sticky CSS to pin the columns to the left or right.

### How Column Pinning Affects Column Order

There are 3 table features that can reorder columns, which happen in the following order:

1. **Column Pinning** - If pinning, columns are split into left, center (unpinned), and right pinned columns.
2. Manual [Column Ordering](../guide/column-ordering) - A manually specified column order is applied.
3. [Grouping](../guide/grouping) - If grouping is enabled, a grouping state is active, and `tableOptions.columnGroupingMode` is set to `'reorder' | 'remove'`, then the grouped columns are reordered to the start of the column flow.

### Column Pinning State

Managing the `columnPinning` state is optional, and usually not necessary unless you are adding persistent state features. TanStack Table will already keep track of the column pinning state for you.
